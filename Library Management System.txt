Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
To ensure that each user only accesses the features relevant to their role, the system can implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This means that each user role will have specific permissions assigned, and users will only see the pages and options relevant to their role when they log in.

For example:

Admins see all system settings, user management, and advanced reports.
Librarians see book management, member management, and basic reporting options.
Library Assistants see book issuing/returning and member assistance tools.
Members see their borrowing history and available books.
Guests may only see the library catalog with no login required.
